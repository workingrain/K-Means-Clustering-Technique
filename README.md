# K-Means-Clustering-Technique

#### PROPOSAL OF QUESTION
Using the K-means clustering technique, what are the distinct patient segments based on their Total Charge and Income?
#### DEFINED GOAL
This analysis aims to identify homogeneous patient groups using k-means clustering based on TotalCharge and Income. This enables the hospital to tailor healthcare services, allocate resources efficiently, and develop targeted financial assistance programs. 

#### EXPLANATION OF CLUSTERING TECHNIQUE
K-means clustering can be employed to analyze the dataset, which consists of patient data regarding TotalCharge and Income. Initially, the variables TotalCharge and Income are preprocessed. This may involve standardizing the data to ensure that both variables contribute equally to the clustering process. Before applying k-means clustering, the elbow method and/or silhouette analysis are used to determine the optimal number of clusters (k). Then, random initial centroids are assigned to each cluster. These centroids represent the mean of the data points within each cluster. Then, each data point is assigned to the cluster whose centroid is closest to it based on a distance metric. After the initial assignment, the centroids of the clusters are recalculated by taking the mean of all data points assigned to each cluster. Assigning data points and updating centroids are repeated iteratively until convergence. Finally, convergence is achieved, the clustering process is finalized, and each patient is assigned to a specific cluster based on the final centroids.
Expected outcomes of K-means clustering are the segmentation of patients and homogenous patient groups. The patients will be segmented into distinct groups based on their TotalCharge and Income characteristics. Moreover, each cluster will represent a group of patients with similar TotalCharge and Income profiles.
#### SUMMARY OF THE TECHNIQUE ASSUMPTION
An assumption of the k-means clustering technique is that clusters are spherical and of similar size. This means that the algorithm assumes that the data points within each cluster are tightly grouped around the cluster centroid in a spherical shape and that the clusters are roughly equal in size.
#### RESULTS & IMPLICATIONS
The table below provides a summary of the characteristics of each cluster identified in the clustering analysis. The gender distribution is 50.18% female, 47.68% male, and 2.14% nonbinary.
Cluster	Female	Male	Non-binary	Age	Income	Total Charge
0	50.98%	46.98%	2.04%	54.0	-0.413698	-0.981812
1	49.83%	47.97%	2.19%	53.0	-0.396655	1.006446
2	48.93%	48.80%	2.27%	53.0	1.565609	-0.378333
Cluster 0 represents a diverse group of patients with almost the same gender distribution as the dataset. The median age suggests that this cluster includes patients who may be in the middle to older age range. The negative median income indicates that patients in this cluster may have lower incomes on average. The negative median total charge suggests that patients in this cluster may have incurred lower healthcare charges on average. Healthcare services tailored for this cluster may address the needs of middle to older-aged individuals with lower incomes. Resource allocation efforts could prioritize financial assistance programs for patients in this cluster who may face financial barriers to healthcare access. 
Cluster 1 represents another diverse group of patients in terms of gender, with a median age like Cluster 0. The median income suggests that patients in this cluster may have slightly higher incomes compared to 0. However, the positive median total charge indicates that patients in this cluster may have incurred higher healthcare charges on average. Healthcare services for this cluster may need to address the healthcare needs of patients with slightly higher incomes who still face significant healthcare expenses. Strategies for resource allocation could focus on providing services that address the specific healthcare needs of this group.
Cluster 2 represents another diverse group of patients in terms of gender and age, like the other clusters. However, this cluster stands out for its notably higher median income than the others. Despite the higher income, patients in this cluster have lower healthcare charges on average compared to the other clusters. Healthcare services for this cluster may need to consider the unique healthcare utilization patterns of patients with higher incomes but lower healthcare charges. Resource allocation efforts could focus on preventive care programs to promote healthy behavior and reduce healthcare costs over time. 
Overall, the clustering analysis reveals distinct segments based patient segments based on demographic and financial characteristics. This is crucial in providing valuable insights for tailoring healthcare services, allocating resources efficiently, and developing financial assistance programs. Healthcare providers can use these insights to design targeted interventions that address the specific needs of each patient segment. This is essential in improving healthcare outcomes and enhancing the overall efficiency of healthcare delivery. 
#### LIMITATION
While the analysis focuses on total charge income, other factors could significantly influence healthcare utilization patterns and financial circumstances. Other factors, such as patient demographics, medical history, geographic location, or lifestyle factors, could provide a more comprehensive understanding of patient characteristics and behaviors. Without considering these additional variables, the clustering analysis may provide an incomplete picture of patient segmentation and may not capture all relevant aspects of patient diversity. As a result, the strategies developed based on the clustering results may not fully address the diverse needs of the patient population.
#### COURSE OF ACTION
The organization can take the following actions: customize healthcare services, optimize resource allocation, and create financial aid programs. 
Firstly, develop customized healthcare services tailored to the specific needs of each patient cluster identified in the analysis. The organization can design interventions and programs that address the healthcare priorities within each cluster. Importantly, consider their demographic and financial challenges. 
Moreover, allocate resources efficiently by targeting interventions and services to patient clusters with the most significant healthcare needs and potential for impact. The organization can prioritize resource allocation based on healthcare utilization patterns and patients' financial circumstances within each cluster. 
Lastly, develop targeted financial assistance programs to support patients facing financial barriers to healthcare access. The organization can tailor financial assistance initiatives to the unique needs and circumstances of patient clusters identified in the analysis. This ensures that resources are allocated effectively to those who need them most.
